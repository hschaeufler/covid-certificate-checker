# Covid Certificate Checker Library
This Library is for parsing and verifying EU Electronic Health Certificates. Like the digital EU Covid Certificate.
## Why another Library
There are already some great Javascript-Libraries, who are helping to decode and verify a digital Covid-Certificate. 
But most of them targets a NodeJS Environment or make it necessary to use polyfills for NodeJS-Functions. 
Like the Buffer-Api or the NodeJS-Crpto-Module. The library is intended for web browsers and mobile first.
## How does it works?
Have a look at the official repository of the Euorpean eHealth network. 
There is a [overview](https://github.com/ehn-dcc-development/hcert-spec/blob/main/README.md) about the Design Principals. And also a [rudimentary Implementation-Example](https://github.com/ehn-dcc-development/ehn-sign-verify-javascript-trivial).
## Usage
Further Information about Usage will come soon.
